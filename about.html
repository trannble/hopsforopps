   <p id="aboutparagraph"> Some afterschool and summer enrichment programs can cost thousands of dollars, but not all!

A few clicks will give parents and students a plethora of information about the latest free and low cost educational opportunities. Founded in July of 2019, Hops for Opps is expanding everyday to cover more communities. Let’s leap toward a brighter future!

        <p class="role">Co-Founder</p>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trannble/" class="fa fa-linkedin"></a>
        <p>Inspired by her childhood memories where she yearned for recreational classes—but kept silent knowing that these were luxuries her parents could not afford—Tran co-founded this website to help other younger students like herself. Tran is involved in various organizations in her community and is a huge supporter of women in STEM. She co-leads free STEM programs at Weller and Pomeroy Elementary School where she teaches free interactive lessons to younger students, as well as a peer tutoring program at her high school. She strives to make educational opportunities known and available to every student in her community.</p>

        <h3>Anastasia Trushchankova</h3>
        <p class="role">Co-Founder</p>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anastasia-t-3b815118b" class="fa fa-linkedin"></a>
        <p>Anastasia is a hard-working and passionate student who likes to play volleyball and help others through volunteer work. This year, she has pursued her interest in STEM by joining her school’s Women in STEM club, learning how to program, participating in hackathons, and participating in Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. After experiencing the summertime boredom as a younger child and understanding how difficult it may be to find local and affordable summer programs, she hopes that this website provides opportunities for anyone who needs it.

        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishika-singh-39021a162/" class="fa fa-linkedin"></a>
        <p>Growing up in the Bay Area, Rishika felt fortunate enough to have access to many opportunities that allowed her to explore her passions, whether that was in more technical fields like robotics, or more creative outlets like dance. Being a part of multiple organizations, she understood how difficult it was to market opportunities, and encourage students from lower income backgrounds to be notified of these opportunities. She hopes that co-founding this website makes it one step easier for students to find opportunities that truly interest them and make a positive impact on their futures.
